# MiddleCraft

Middlecraft (will be) advanced middleware for Minecraft, with a focus on servers.  The idea is to create a familiar API for developers to use, one that doesn't change as often and suddenly as the Minecraft code itself.

## Compiling

First, ensure you have the latest Sun JDK installed.  Next, dump minecraft_server.jar into lib/ and run the compile script for your platform and MiddleCraft will do the rest!  Middlecraft will end up in the bin/ directory.

## Running

Dump your desired plugins into the plugins directory and run MiddleCraft.jar.
